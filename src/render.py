renderer.py

This module is responsible for converting a chromosome into a visual image.
It uses the OpenCV library to create and manipulate images, and the OpenSimplex library to generate noise-based patterns.
Uses the noise2 which is a 2D noise function that generates smooth, natural-looking patterns that can be used to create fluid-like distortions in the image.

The output is a generated image that visually represents the parameters encoded in the chromosome,
which are then saved to disk.
